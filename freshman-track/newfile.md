## Level 7 - Creating a Mood Diary dApp
Created a mood diary where you can input a mood and set it in the deployed smart contract. Thereafter, you can also get the mood, which will display in the console (Need to press Ctrl+Shift+i to display). Ropsten testnet was used. 
Two files:
- mood.sol   -> code that was compiled and deployed using Remix IDE
- index.html  -> frontend of dApp
