## Level 7 - Creating a Mood Diary dApp
Created a mood diary where you can input a mood and set it in the deployed smart contract. Thereafter, you can also get the mood, which will display in the console (Need to press Ctrl+Shift+i to display). Ropsten testnet was used. 
Two files:
- mood.sol   -> code that was compiled and deployed using Remix IDE
- index.html  -> frontend of dApp

## Level 8 - Creating my own Cryptocurrency
Coded a file on Remix IDE and compiled it. Before deploying it on the Rinkeby Testnet, I had to enter the name and symbol of my cryptocurrency. Once the contract is deployed, I can copy the contract address and import custom assets on metamask. 
One file:
- LW3Token.sol
